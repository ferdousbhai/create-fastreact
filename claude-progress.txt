# create-fastreact - Development Progress

## Project Summary

**What it does**: A CLI scaffolding tool (`pnpm create fastreact`) that generates full-stack AI-powered projects with:
- Frontend: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- Backend: FastAPI on Modal (serverless Python)
- AI Agent: Autonomous coding agent that builds apps from plain-English descriptions

**Technology Stack**:
- CLI: Node.js + TypeScript (tsup build)
- Template system: Handlebars templates (.hbs files)
- Package manager: pnpm (for Node.js), uv (for Python)
- Cloud: Modal for serverless deployment

**Project Structure**:

## Current Task (from app_spec.txt)

Framework validation and agentic flow architecture improvement:
1. Verify all README-documented features work as intended
2. Identify and remove dead/unused code
3. Review and document bugs, inconsistencies, or architectural issues
4. Adapt agentic flow patterns from `autonomous-claude` to fit React + FastAPI + Modal

## Initial Assessment

### Key Observations

1. **Agent Schema Inconsistency**: The agent's `count_passing_features()` function in `agent.py` expects a nested `categories[].features[]` structure, but the feature_list.json format in prompts also uses this format. Need to verify consistency.

2. **CLI Flow**: The CLI handles Modal installation/login gracefully with interactive prompts, then scaffolds a complete project with all dependencies.

3. **Agentic Architecture**: Two-phase approach:
   - Initializer: Reads app_spec.md → generates feature_list.json
   - Coder: Implements features one-by-one from feature_list.json

4. **Security**: Agent has bash command allowlist with restrictions on dangerous operations (rm -rf limited to build dirs, kill limited to dev processes).

### Potential Issues to Investigate

1. **Feature list schema**: Verify the generated schema matches what the parser expects
2. **Template file handling**: Ensure .hbs files are correctly processed and .gitignore renamed
3. **Modal proxy auth**: The `requires_proxy_auth=True` default may cause issues if tokens aren't set
4. **Dev server startup**: README mentions `pnpm run dev` in root but may not exist in generated projects

## Session Notes

### Session 1 - Setup (2024-12-05)
- Analyzed existing codebase structure
- Created feature_list.json with 13 tasks covering validation, bugfix, enhancement, and refactor work
- Created init.sh for dev environment setup
- Configured Puppeteer MCP for web testing
- Ready for coding agent to begin implementation
