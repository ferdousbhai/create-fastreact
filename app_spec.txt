# Task: Framework Validation and Agentic Flow Architecture Improvement

## Overview
Validate that the project functions as documented in its README, identify and remove dead/unused code, review for bugs and architectural issues, then improve the agentic flow architecture by adapting patterns from the `autonomous-claude` reference project to fit the React + FastAPI + Modal stack.

## Requirements
- Verify all README-documented features work as intended
- Identify and remove dead/unused code throughout the codebase
- Review and document bugs, inconsistencies, or architectural issues
- Adapt agentic flow patterns from `autonomous-claude` to fit React + FastAPI + Modal architecture
- Keep code concise and maintainable
- Research latest docs and best practices for the technology stack as needed

## Guidelines
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in both projects
- Adapt patterns thoughtfully—don't force-fit incompatible architectural decisions
- Prioritize fixes that align with the project's technology choices (React, FastAPI, Modal)
- Document significant changes or recommendations
