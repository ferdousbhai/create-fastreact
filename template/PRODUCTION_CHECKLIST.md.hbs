# Production Verification Checklist for {{projectName}}

Use this checklist to verify your production deployment is working correctly.

## Pre-Deployment Verification

- [ ] All features in `feature_list.json` have `"passes": true`
- [ ] App tested locally and working
- [ ] `frontend/.env.local` contains `VITE_MODAL_KEY` and `VITE_MODAL_SECRET`
- [ ] Modal secrets configured (if app requires any)

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Backend (Modal)

**Production URL:** ____________________________________

- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200: `curl -H "Modal-Key: $KEY" -H "Modal-Secret: $SECRET" <url>/api/health`
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] No errors in Modal dashboard logs

### Frontend (Vercel)

**Production URL:** ____________________________________

- [ ] Site loads without errors
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools
- [ ] Environment variables configured:
  - [ ] `VITE_API_URL` points to Modal production URL
  - [ ] `VITE_MODAL_KEY` is set
  - [ ] `VITE_MODAL_SECRET` is set

### Integration

- [ ] API calls from frontend reach Modal backend
- [ ] Authentication works (no 401 errors)
- [ ] All core user flows work in production

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized

1. Verify proxy auth token is valid at https://modal.com/settings/proxy-auth-tokens
2. Check Vercel environment variables match the token values
3. Redeploy frontend: `cd frontend && vercel --prod`

### API Calls to Wrong URL

1. Check `VITE_API_URL` in Vercel (should be production URL without `-dev`)
2. Ensure no trailing slash
3. Redeploy frontend: `cd frontend && vercel --prod`
