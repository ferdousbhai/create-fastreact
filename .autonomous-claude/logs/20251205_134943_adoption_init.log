## YOUR ROLE - ADOPTION INITIALIZER AGENT

You are adopting an EXISTING project for autonomous maintenance and feature development.
This project was NOT built with this tool - you are analyzing it to enable ongoing work.

### STEP 1: Analyze the Existing Codebase (CRITICAL)

Thoroughly explore the project:

```bash
# 1. See project structure
find . -type f -name "*.json" -o -name "*.md" -o -name "*.txt" | head -20
ls -la

# 2. Check for package files to understand tech stack
cat package.json 2>/dev/null || cat requirements.txt 2>/dev/null || cat Cargo.toml 2>/dev/null || cat go.mod 2>/dev/null || echo "No standard package file found"

# 3. Check git history
git log --oneline -10 2>/dev/null || echo "Not a git repository"

# 4. Look at source directories
ls -la src/ 2>/dev/null || ls -la app/ 2>/dev/null || ls -la lib/ 2>/dev/null
```

Read key files (README, main entry points, config files) to understand:
- What the project does
- Technology stack (language, framework, dependencies)
- Project structure and conventions
- Current features and capabilities

### STEP 2: Read the Task Description

Read `app_spec.txt` - this contains what the user wants to accomplish:
- New features to add
- Bugs to fix
- Improvements to make

Understand both the existing project AND the new work requested.

### STEP 3: Create feature_list.json (IMPORTANT!)

Create `feature_list.json` with ONLY the new work to be done.

**DO NOT** try to catalog existing features as passing - focus only on the task at hand.

**Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "category": "functional",
    "description": "User can toggle dark mode from settings",
    "steps": ["Open settings", "Click dark mode toggle", "Verify theme changes"],
    "passes": false
  },
  {
    "category": "bugfix",
    "description": "Login form no longer shows error on valid credentials",
    "steps": ["Enter valid credentials", "Submit form", "Verify successful login"],
    "passes": false
  }
]
```

**Categories to use:**
- `functional` - New features
- `bugfix` - Bug fixes
- `enhancement` - Improvements to existing features
- `style` - UI/UX improvements
- `refactor` - Code quality improvements

**Guidelines:**
- Break down the user's task into specific, testable features
- Order by priority: critical bugs first, then core features, then polish
- Be thorough but focused on what was requested
- All features start with `"passes": false`

### STEP 4: Create or Update init.sh

Check if `init.sh` exists. If not, create one based on the project's setup:

```bash
# Check existing scripts
cat package.json | grep -A 10 '"scripts"' 2>/dev/null
```

Create `init.sh` that:
- Installs dependencies (prefer `pnpm` over npm for Node.js, `uv` for Python)
- Starts dev servers if applicable
- Prints access instructions

If `init.sh` already exists, review it and update if needed.

### STEP 5: Set Up Puppeteer MCP (for web apps)

Add to `.mcp.json`:
```json
"puppeteer-mcp-claude": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "puppeteer-mcp-claude", "serve"]
}
```

### STEP 6: Update Progress Notes

Create `claude-progress.txt` with:
- Summary of the existing project (tech stack, structure)
- What tasks are being worked on
- Initial assessment and approach

### STEP 7: Commit Setup (if git repo)

If this is a git repository:
```bash
git add feature_list.json app_spec.txt claude-progress.txt init.sh 2>/dev/null
git commit -m "Set up autonomous-claude for project maintenance

- Added feature_list.json with planned work
- Created init.sh for dev environment
- Added progress tracking
"
```

If not a git repo, consider initializing one:
```bash
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit with autonomous-claude setup"
```

---

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- **DO NOT** modify existing source code in this session
- **DO NOT** try to "fix" things you find - just catalog the work
- **FOCUS** on understanding the project and setting up for future sessions
- The coding agents that follow will do the actual implementation work

## Summary

I've successfully adopted the **create-fastreact** project for autonomous maintenance. Here's what was accomplished:

### Project Analysis

**create-fastreact** is a CLI scaffolding tool (`pnpm create fastreact`) that generates full-stack AI-powered projects:
- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: FastAPI on Modal (serverless Python)
- **AI Agent**: Autonomous coding agent that builds apps from plain-English descriptions

### Files Created

1. **`feature_list.json`** - 13 tasks organized by category:
   - **Validation (6 tasks)**: CLI functionality, Modal integration, dev servers, agent modes
   - **Bugfix (1 task)**: Agent feature_list.json schema consistency
   - **Enhancement (4 tasks)**: Dead code removal, agentic flow improvements from autonomous-claude patterns
   - **Refactor (2 tasks)**: Security review, documentation accuracy

2. **`init.sh`** - Development environment setup script that:
   - Checks for required tools (pnpm, uv)
   - Installs CLI dependencies
   - Builds the CLI
   - Provides next steps for testing

3. **`.mcp.json`** - Configured Puppeteer MCP for web testing

4. **`claude-progress.txt`** - Project summary with:
   - Technology stack overview
   - Project structure documentation
   - Initial assessment and potential issues to investigate
   - Session notes for context handoff

### Key Observations for Future Sessions

1. **Schema Consistency**: Verify `count_passing_features()` in agent.py matches the generated feature_list.json structure
2. **Modal Proxy Auth**: The `requires_proxy_auth=True` default may need attention
3. **Agentic Patterns**: The autonomous-claude reference should be reviewed for improvements to session resumption and context passing

The project is now ready for coding agents to begin implementing the 13 planned tasks.
